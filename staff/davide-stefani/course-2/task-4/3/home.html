          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society, transparency
            is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens
            hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
            transparent.</p>
          <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business and
            spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
            and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
            about what their Government is doing.</p>
          <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
            effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
            and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
            our site to become actively engaged in American government.</p>
          <p>TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
            public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.<span id="dots">..</span>

            <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
            <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible to
              public
              opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
              attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project.
              The
              passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
              Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting
              free
              press legislation as part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
              approach,
              and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on
              the
              eighteenth-century public sphere.

            <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
              freedom
              of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
              freedom
              of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by
              Metternichean
              statesmen to row back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent
              liberal
              politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

            <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice and
              is
              often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries
              claim
              to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its
              modern
              provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness
              after
              gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951
              (superseded by new legislation in 1999).</p>

            <p>The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
              Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.</p>
