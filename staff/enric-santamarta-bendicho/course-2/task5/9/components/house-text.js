    <h2>Congressmen</h2>
    <p class="maintext">The major power of the House is to pass federal legislation that affects the entire
        country,
        although its bills must also be passed by the Senate
        and further agreed to by the U.S. President before becoming law (unless both the House and Senate
        re-pass
        the legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber). The House has some exclusive powers: the
        power
        to initiate revenue bills, to impeach officials (impeached officials are subsequently tried in the
        Senate),
        and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no majority in the Electoral College.
        Each U.S. state is represented in the House in proportion to its population as measured in the census,
        but
        every state is entitled to at least one representative. </p>
