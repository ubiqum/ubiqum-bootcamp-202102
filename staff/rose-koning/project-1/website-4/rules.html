                within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
                and older.</li>
            <li class="details rules"><b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition program must
                be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
                participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
                field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
                dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
                associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
                required to play all their games away.</li>
