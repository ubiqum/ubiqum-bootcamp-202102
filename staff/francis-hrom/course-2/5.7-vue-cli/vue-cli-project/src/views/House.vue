                    by the Senate and further agreed to by the U.S. President before
                    becoming law (unless both the House and Senate re-pass the
                    legislation with a two-thirds majority in each chamber). The House
                    has some exclusive powers: the power to initiate revenue bills, to
                    impeach officials (impeached officials are subsequently tried in the
                    Senate), and to elect the U.S. President in case there is no
